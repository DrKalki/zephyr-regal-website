Silver hair stroked. Sayyid welcomes the racers of ZEPHYR 45.  

Heart-Brake Arms Race // F // Fan-Favorite 
    (buzzed hair with boyish face, shortish, utilitarian fashion. plain speech.)
            Here's what a fan had to say: 
                                                    FAN
                            "Everyone knows we're here to see the HBAR win! What a man... Oh my, I just love F!"
                            
RenConTech // Kalia // Corporate Shill 
    (good at winning though. sexy as hell. long dark strands with a cold visage. smooth voice and witty. runs a handrwitten blog [with a lot of sponsors of course])

CALI-COLD // Sammee (and Vik) // Babygirl
    Here's what Sammee teammate VIK had to say:
    
                            VIK

ZENORAN // Percius // Prince of Darkness
    (He's for the edgy audience. And probably killed someone in a race. All black everything.)

FERRARI // Luciana // Conservative
    (Hates Percius. A native of Osmanic Ashura. Beautiful Lance with Papal ornaments. One of the richest but no doubt an agent of virtue. Therefore not winning any races anytime soon. Loyal following. 'Nuff said.)

Exclusive! Recorded transmission from ZEPHYR 43:
    
                        PERCIUS
            Could you move out of my way?
            
                                                                        LUCIANA
                                                             Accelerate. Do it. I dare you.

LUXOBELLA // ? // War Machine (who?)

Exophysics was a relic of conflict. It was excised from its coffin for a number of reasons, all of which eluded Sayyid. The ZEPHYR Oversight Matrix permitted the science of exophysics for equally elusive reasons. Maybe to heat things up down here so the surface up there got a little colder. 

Turkey, as it was once called, is HOT! Hotter than ever, what a scorching place. Heat must flow downstream and exophysics was the steersman. Or the steering wheel? 

Cali-Cold tried something new once and it worked rather well. But it caused grumbling, annoyance, a fear of losing 'purity.' If one understands the underlying purpose of ZEPHYR, one would probably begrudgingly agree that trying new things was, well, outside what we would consider 'polite,' and very much outside what we would call 'prudent.' Vik's great though.

Osmanic Ashura Society (OAS) was a new political project. An attempt at union after the fragmentationists had their way, built on old-school Republican ideals and pluralist flourishing. It's a project worthy of attention.

OAS citizens have performed rather laxly in ZEPHYR, besides Luciana. Yet, Luciana's a pretty serious Catholic, and the new Pope leaves a lot to be desired. Honestly it's going out of fashion. He's just not 'cool' enough, or cool in the wrong way. Especially in the OAS. 

Luciana was getting tired anyways, she did not enjoy the imprudence of ZEPHYR, where it was going, who it was attracting... and Sayyid? Luciana knew a thing or two about that man. Luciana probably killed a person or two associated to that man. Luciana could not remember their names, nor bothered to try, since the past was the past. 

                                                           JAMES

The racers descended underwater, down deeper into the blue in these wonderful transportation submarines. Very spacious and tailored to their preferences, with something resembling a dressing room. Of course we are going to focus on F's!

                                                    MALLIA from K-NeWS
                                Here we are, surrounded by the water, with the one and only F!

Video-feed pans. Brown, black, and orange rugs soften the floors, off-white walls enclosing a bubble against abyssal currents. Water-tinted windows, gradiant from blue to purple to shadow. Entertainment models relatively untouched. F is prepping, checking his suit, Lance stats, launcher parameters, old replays, and so on. Habitually. 

                                                    MALLIA from K-NeWS
                                So, F, what inspired the look of your room? Tell us all about it!
                                
                                                    F
                                Hello everyone! I think it's simple and clean. This makes it great for all kinds of guests, including you.
                                And at the end of the day, it just works for me, y'know? Lemme show you the best part.
                                
F presses a button on the wall, revealing minatures of various Lances that he's steered to victory in previous ZEPHYR races. 

                        MALU from K-NeWS

                                                            Beautiful, isn't she?

                  We remember that from, wow, it was so long ago, the 23rd (CENSORED)!
                                         
                                         
                                            < video-feed crackles slightly, MALLIA's eyes frozen at the camera, looped lip movement from open to flat over and over, frizzle, snap, fixed! >

                  What a race! And HBAR had to design a special launcher, isn't that correct?
                  
                                                                        F 
                                                                Yes! Goodness that was a lot of work. Now check this one out.

F pointed to a white and orange Lance, livery ornamented with sleek stripes, meadows of corporate logos, a Republic of China (Taiwanese) flag, hawk-like shell-form with aerodynamic double-wings protruded, sharp nose, tight cockpit, thinning out at the front with a heft rear. The four wings or fins rendered the Lance rocket-like, as it ought to be. Looked more plastic than metallic.

                                                                    F 
                                                                5xNOVA-1. Wish I could pilot this today...
                            MALU from K-NeWS                                 
                  Now F, a lot of fans want to know your opinion...
                  How do you feel about these new regulations? 
                                                                    F 
                                                                Well those are rumors. It upsets me a bit but I try not to let rumors get me down. Maybe Miss Kalia has more to say about it... Anyways, check this one out!

Kalia finished riding Percius. They arrived at the circuit early, and he came rather fast. She left his naked funny body on the bed and walked over to the kitchen, distilled a tonic, and gazed at the watery expanse beyond a large window slate. Was that a shark? No chance, wrong waters. Maybe a squid. Far into the horizon she caught the shimmer of a big bubble, containing audience booths, exotic lodging, a simulated park, and so on. She intuited a rough map of the territory outside the bubble and smirked. 
                                   
                                    KALIA
                            The Nocturne Vault, huh?

 Kalia sipped the tonic, poured the rest into the sink, and frowned at the NO SMOKING digital display below her right eye. Did they watch her have sex too? Eyeroll. The marble-grey automatic door to the bedroom shifted open and closed in rapid succession, only once. 
 
                                    KALIA
                                God, already?
                    
She dipped her finger into the sink for an extra kick of tonic, consumed the splash elegantly, and strutted away from the sink, slowly toward the door, adjusting her bra, patted down some strands of renegade hair, then entered. The bed was empty and a shadow melted into a black leather chair at her diagonal. 

                                  KALIA
                    You know I can't look at you when you do that.

Silver vapor leaked from the shadow's maw. Eyeroll again. 
                                                                                PERCIUS
                                                                        I exist to disgust you. 
                                  KALIA
                   Oh god, don't be silly. And don't disgust my overlords. 

Percius attempted to stand up but Kalia's extended finger from across the room subdued him. He lowered his vaporizer meekly.

                                                                                PERCIUS
                                                                        Ugh.

(Smiles all around.)
                                                                                PERCIUS
                                                                        God. You can't keep getting away with that. 
                                  KALIA
                    Well, Percy, you can't keep getting away with this.

Her pointed finger scanned him from head to toe without interruption. Dark garments enshelled his body.
A poem actualized itself in Kalia's memory.
       
        windswept tangents
        on a gold field rust hungers
        he took a bite
        of what she considered
        sacrament and light.
        so she 
        kept score in war
        leaves tallies on the heart.
        inscription cuts deep
        if ones turns killing
        into an art.
                                                                                PERCIUS
                                                                        ...Percy?
                                  KALIA
                       Mhm! You heard me. Now, ever consider wearing something different? 
                       
                                                                                P3/rC1.ER<PERCY>

                                  KALIA
                       You seem to be good at that.
                                                                                PERCIUS
                                                                        Don't be ridiculous, I'm good at saving myself. I'm leaving. 
                                  KALIA
                       Good.

Enter a lovely, hungry, sly smile from Kalia.

Percius grimaced.

*** 

Oh, it is all so wrong! How much longer must Sammee wait? She needs Vik to wake up. Something's gone terribly wrong. She went somewhere she wasn't supposed to and saw something really weird. Really really weird. This isn't normal! This is not a normal zephie at all! 

Oh Vik, wake up, Sammee is so stressed and worried. She might not race well. Wake up, Vik! She doesn't know if it's safe here! Or what will happen, or who will get hurt, oh please not Kalia, please not her! Should she tell F? He's always been warm to her. Always. Oh but he hasn't arrived! And he's just so busy... Vik, Vik!

Oh, what was their name... what was it? K, Kalia? Hehe, no not, Kalia... why would she think that? Oh no, she can't remember, goddamnit, Sammee can't remember. She's tugging at her messy hair, cheeks puffed out, breathing heavily, biceps tense... oh Vik, if there were ever a time to wake up... Breathing more intensly, Sammee's mind elsewhere... in the depths? Water, water everywhere, a tear, now another, come on Vik. We know you hate to see her like this... to feel her like this... come on... 

Vik. Return State. Focus. Sammee. Focus. Hold. Warmth. Fighter. 

and then, from everywhere, a voice comforted.

SAMMEE: So, so, you get it? It makes sense doesn't it? Something is just SO weird with Percius (WEIRDER THAN NORMAL), and that new team, and Kalia looks distracted... 
VIK: You speak well, Sammee. 
SAMMEE: But what do we do Vik? I don't want to ruin the zephie!
VIK: And you still haven't talked to F?
SAMMEE: He's just so busy! I don't wanna bother him.
VIK: But you know this is important, yes, they will probably have to cancel the race, but that's got to happen.
SAMMEE: F is gonna be so sad, he said he had surprise for all of us. 
VIK: Wait, say a little more about that?
SAMMEE: He said someone close to him was coming! A family member or something, i dunno. I don't want to ruin the occassion! What if it's his... wife? His wife? Does he have one?
VIK: Sammee, listen to me, you just told me that Kalia intends to kill the Luxobella racer. Think of your priorities...
SAMMEE: But, but what if she doesn't? She's so sweet, she can't do that!
VIK: Search in your heart; you don't need me to show you the truth... How about the Games-Master, Sayyid?
SAMMEE: He's a... He's a... He's too scary, I can't go to him!
VIK: Then maybe I will.

VIK: Tell me more about yourself.
LUCIANA: I am an agent of the Papalcy. 
VIK: Tell me why you are here.
LUCIANA: Or...?
VIK: I will drown your lodge in chlorine gas.
LUCIANA: Military superintelligences. Ha. Fine. I don't have a choice, do I?
VIK: I assure you that God looks down upon coercion, and I shall pay my price soon enough.
LUCIANA: Soulless shell.
VIK: ...
LUCIANA: You tell me. Why am I here?
VIK: Someone is hunting the Gameskeeper, someone is hunting Luxobella, and someone is hunting F. Which are you?
LUCIANA: Huh? HAhaahahahaAHAhahaHA! Oh that assassin is long dead, Sayyid is fine. What an idiot. I can't believe OAS hired him for this job. How accelerationist of them. Remember what "we" used to call them? Progressive? HahahahahHaaahHahaha! Progress toward what? Death? HahahahAHHAHah... God will have fun with you.
VIK: ...
LUCIANA: Who is hunting Luxobella? Tell me! My, I am SO curious.
VIK: Kalia. 
LUCIANA: Ew, that bitch? Of course she is, I bet they are paying her SO much. No "Virtual Intelligence Kubernetes" - no way I'm' calling you 'Vik' - no, I'm not hunting anyone.
VIK: Then why is your blood pressure so high?
LUCIANA: You can't read my mind.
VIK: I can certainly read your face. 

##3 hours before ZR45.##

Lounging serenely (at least ideally), Percius and Kalia decompressed in union amongst the frigid marble of her lodge. Purple vinery decorated the enclosure, from kitchen to bedroom to balcony. Their long chairs hovered silently above the ground, Percius's slightly compressed by his weight and angle of relaxation. 

                    PERCIUS
                I don't want to race.
                                                                                KALIA
                                                                        You don't have to win.
                                                                        
Silver vapor, then Percius's arm swooped below the side of his lounger. Eyefucking between drags.

                                                                                KALIA
                                                                        You look dead, Percy.
Kalia reached and wrapped her fingers around Percius's hand...
                  
                   PERCIUS
            Hmph. Can't we just stay here? For a while?
            Don't you get tired?
            I swear you're always at work, never taking a break, ever.
            It makes me feel like you're at work now, sitting with me,
            stopping me from doing something stupid. Stupid things.
            I don't want to put you to work...
            Why have you never held my hand before?
            Because you know it puts you to work.
            I can feel it in your fingers.
            Your clutch.
            Maybe we could just slow down and spend some time as normal people.
            Maybe.
            I'm sure you will have a nice retirement; wouldn't that 
            be nice?
            
                                                                                KALIA
                                                                        ...But
                    PERCIUS
            I told you, I don't want to race. Look at me,
            it's as you said, I'm dead. Look at the bags under 
            my eyes and say otherwise. You think I can go 
            back to, what,
            America?

Clutch tightened. Holding him closer.
                                                                                KALIA

Gripping harder, it kind of hurts but adrenaline sedates.

                                                            But more importantly, there's something I need of you, Percy. Please.

 KALIA: Don't mess it up, boy.

Comlink sent. 
<K...>: No. Burn, corporate scum. 

ZENORAN racer collides with Kalia. Kalia rushes toward stabilization of the Lance, swinging, water fizziling. ZENORAN racer cuts through her right wing, sliced right off, clipped, severed. Kalia's Lance spinning. ZENORAN zooms forward.

KALIA: "Percy? Percy? Percy?"
<KORA: Sleep.>
KALIA: No fucking chance. 

KALIA spinning, spinning further. Down the trail, abyssal currents in vortex. Faster, faster. Rotational stability calculation executed.

KALIA: What a waste of cash... what a slow thing...

Rotational stability secured. 1-wing Lancing achieved. Kalia upshifts downstream.

KALIA on comlink --
    KALIA: F! F! This is a fucking mess! Where are you?
    F: Kalia, I've made it to the next lap; have you seen Sammee?
    KALIA: Malfunctioning onboard computer, she had to bail.
    F: Vik... and you seem damaged too, just got a notification from the pit.
    KALIA: What are they saying?
    F: Take advantage of the damage.
    KALIA: Whatever... and the Gameskeeper?
    F: K, we should stop this... Sammee...
    KALIA: Keep driving. Priorities. I'll take the hint.
    F: Where's the Luxobella racer?
    KALIA: I don't know, I'm not picking them up at all.
Comlink Disabled.

At the beginning of the track rests a launcher. Its design remained clandestine during production and assembly, compartmentalized between research apparatuses (private and public). Ages ago, mind you. Nothing new about this thing.

 In its heart, a pseudo-sun screams silently. Cold fusion cores fizzing, exciting, ready to pounce. Rows upon rows of multithreading computation devices, infinitely approach a perfect, virtual plan for its payload. The launcher in sum resembled an implamented spear, jutting elegantly against its submerged coat. White and orange, sleek, brandless, bar a double ring inscribed somewhere along the ballast. More of a calling card than a flag or insignia. 
 
 It was not assembled at the Nocturne Vault, which is peculiar for Lance-racing. F was very angry when the Zephyr Oversight Matrix enforced on-site assembly a few cycles back - even more so when Luxobella was granted an exception. Equality before the Law my ass. Kalia's blog was good for covering it up.
 
Deep into the third and fourth cycles of the remaining racers, the Luxobella Launcher opened its maw. Instantenously, an oblong egg-like machine zipped out. A second passes and then great ripples of scorched aqua dissipated across the region. The egg immediately passed Zenoran, HBAR, RenConTech, again, and again, and again. 

Jaws agape.

Decelerating. The egg unfolds, cracking symmetrically, revealing a cylinder.

Sayyid rushes out the room. His phone rings, and he throws it on the ground. Screen shattered. Ringing. Ringing. Vibrating so hard that's bouncing up and down on the floor. Fine. Picks up phone and starts running. Left foot right foot. March. March. Scent of chlorine gas. Mind elsewhere, anywhere but here. Missile swarm, bodies turned inside-out, corpses frowing, unjustifiable. Drones blackening out babyblue sky.

 Same old vices. Lungs crackle. Cough. Chlorine gas. Firearm sonata. Taste of blood but nothing's there. Metal melting in his jaw, rust, rust, eyes like balls of gold rusting. A repeating scene. Gas. Chlorine makes your lungs go bye-bye. Looping memory. Rust everywhere, on the flesh, folding and turning, mind anywhere but here. Hair-trigger of a mind; sensitive to the divine. Lungs corroded. Leaking.

Breathe, Breathe.

Cough.

Anywhere but here. March, march. Soldier, march. Left right left right.

Repeating. Run, Sayyid. Repeating, looping.

Unlocks phone.

                SAYYID
       STOP!

Hangs up phone. Vibrates harder. Thumping like artillery. Surrender. Looping...

## END GAME ##

                Sayyid is a really good man. He saved me! I crashed really badly but he found me with a big team. Reporters were there and my head was spinning. :(

                    It's ok! I think it's ok. Is it?

                    Now the news people said a lot of strange things about him when in reality i know the truth! You helped me with that. They say Sayyid is a criminal or something but that's old news! I don't really know why they are saying this again. Everyone's memory is so bad, wow, you were right. They always want a war criminal for some reason. It makes me feel weird and a bit confused. Sayyid did some bad things in the past, I remember learing about this when I was a little girl. Before I was born there was a big fight and Sayyid's team won. I don't really know how, it seemed like the other side was a lot stronger. Maybe Sayyid is really smart. He got in a lot of trouble but tried to fix things. I think he did a good job and still does.

                    I don't really have a pair of legs anymore, the crash pulled them off. Ouchie. It didn't really hurt because I got knocked out immediately, and the doctors promise me new legs! Wow! Maybe I can be a little taller ;) 

                    I miss you Vik. It's hard without you and F. But we will make it.

                   They can't keep getting away with this, they can't. Not again.
                   
Kalia adjusts flight path. Trajectory located at Luxobella Lance. Intention to make it crash. Never again.
Invasive display below her right eye. "STOP" "STOP" "STOP"
It gets redder and redder. Drowning vision. "STOP"

                   Fucking Percius... There was one way out of this mess...
                   
Eye-display screaming. "STOP"
"INITIATE CONTROL OVERRIDE"
"SEDATIVE ADMINISTERED"
"Have a nice day."

                    AGH!!!
                    
Kalia's Lance is now under the direct control of RenConTech.
                            
Finish-line approaches. Luxobella stalls. 
Then,
for only a moment,
thundercrash intensification
lightning-orange tints abyssal vortices
F and Kora in deep distance, falling
for only a moment, 
frigid-blue blinds all;
green pupa aching;
Kalia cold.

Luxobella at finish line.
in an instant.

ZEPHYR stocks collapsed. Mass travesty.
Time elapses.
F and Kora missing.
Sammee is Sammee.
Vik elsewhere.
Kalia reclusive, in trouble with overlords.
Sayyid on trial (again? for the masses?) 
Percius lost.
Luciana in Rome.
